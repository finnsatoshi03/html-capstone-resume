        <!-- Description -->
        <p>A Computer Science Student from Technical University of the Philippines, and currently not satisfied on what I learned so I find ways to learn more about my interest in Web Development. I am more interested in front-end development since I have a skill on that aspect but I don't want to be comfortable with the skill I only have so I am willing to go out on my comfort skill and to try other development.</p>
